// Unit tests for the CPU models running "full" RISC-V apps

package dinocpu.test


/**
  * This is a trivial example of how to run this Specification
  * From within sbt use:
  * {{{
  * testOnly dinocpu.test.SingleCycleCPUTester
  * }}}
  * From a terminal shell use:
  * {{{
  * sbt 'testOnly dinocpu.test.SingleCycleCPUTester'
  * }}}
  *
  * To run a **single** test from this suite, you can use the -z option to sbt test.
  * The option after the `-z` is a string to search for in the test
  * {{{
  * sbt> testOnly dinocpu.test.SingleCycleCPUTester -- -z beqFalse
  * }}}
  * Or, to run just the r-type instructions you can use `-z rtype`
