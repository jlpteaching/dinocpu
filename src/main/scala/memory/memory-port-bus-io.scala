 * Input:  request, the ready/valid interface for a MemPort module to issue Requests to. Memory
 *         will only accept a request when both request.valid (the MemPort is supplying valid data)
 *         and request.ready (the memory is idling for a request) are high.
 *
 * Output: response, the valid interface for the data outputted by memory if it was requested to read.
 *         the bits in response.bits should only be treated as valid data when response.valid is high.
