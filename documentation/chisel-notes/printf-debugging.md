# `printf` Debugging

 Use printf when you want to print *during the simulation*.
  - Note: this will print *at the end of the cycle* so you'll see the values on the wires after the cycle has passed.
  - Use `printf(p"This is my text with a $var\n")` to print Chisel variables. Notice the "p" before the quote!
  - You can also put any Scala statement in the print statement (e.g., `printf(p"Output: ${io.output})`).
  - Use `println` to print during compilation in the Chisel code or during test execution in the test code. This is mostly like Java's `println`.
  - If you want to use Scala variables in the print statement, prepend the statement with an 's'. For example, `println(s"This is my cool variable: $variable")` or `println("Some math: 5 + 5 = ${5+5}")`.
  - print statements will be carried over to generated verilog as `$fwrite()`
