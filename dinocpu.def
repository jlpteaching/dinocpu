%help
    This container is set up for building, testing, and simulating the DINO CPU.
    When run, this container executes sbt and will drop you into the sbt shell.

    If you want to run a different command in this container, you can use
    singularity exec <image.sif> <your command>. You may want to increase the
    memory for sbt as the runscript above.
